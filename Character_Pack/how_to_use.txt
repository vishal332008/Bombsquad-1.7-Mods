IF YOU WANT TO USE THE CHARACTER PACK , DO THE FOLLOWING STEPS :

1. DISABLE THE PRO UNLOCKER YOU ARE USING AND USE THE "ProUnlocker_updated.py".
2. ADD THE CHARACTER PACK PY AND THE CHARACTER PACK FOLDER INTO THE BOMBSQUAD FOLDER/MODS FOLDER.
3. ENABLE ALL THE SETS (SET1 , SET2 , SET3) AND RESTART BOMBSQUAD.

IF YOU WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO NORMAL , DISABLE ALL THE 3 SETS AND ENABLE "RESTORE TO ORIGINAL" AND RESTART BOMBSQUAD.
IT WILL CHANGE IT BACK TO NORMAL , THEN YOU CAN DISABLE "RESTORE TO ORIGINAL".
